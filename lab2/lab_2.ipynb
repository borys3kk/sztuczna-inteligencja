Dotyczy on klasyfikacji, na podstawie danych z raportów finansowych, czy firma zbankrutuje w ciągu najbliższych kilku lat. Jest to zadanie szczególnie istotne dla banków, funduszy inwestycyjnych, firm ubezpieczeniowych itp., które z tego powodu zatrudniają licznie data scientistów. Zbiór zawiera 64 cechy, obliczone przez ekonomistów, którzy stworzyli ten zbiór, są one opisane na podlinkowanej wcześniej stronie. Dotyczą one zysków, posiadanych zasobów oraz długów firm.\n",

    "Jak widać, klasa pozytywna jest w znacznej mniejszości, stanowi poniżej 5% zbioru. Taki problem nazywamy **klasyfikacją niezbalansowaną (imbalanced classification)**. Mamy tu **klasę dominującą (majority class)** oraz **klasę mniejszościową (minority class)**. Pechowo prawie zawsze interesuje nas ta druga, bo klasa większościowa jest trywialna. Przykładowo, 99% badanych jest zdrowych, a 1% ma niewykryty nowotwór - z oczywistych przyczyn chcemy wykrywać właśnie sytuację rzadką (problem diagnozy jako klasyfikacji jest zasadniczo zawsze niezbalansowany). W dalszej części laboratorium poznamy szereg konsekwencji tego zjawiska i metody na radzenie sobie z nim.\n",

    "Jak widać, cecha 37 ma bardzo dużo wartości brakujących, podczas gdy pozostałe cechy mają raczej niewielką ich liczbę. W takiej sytuacji najlepiej usunąć tę cechę, a pozostałe wartości brakujące **uzupełnić / imputować (impute)**. Typowo wykorzystuje się do tego wartość średnią lub medianę z danej kolumny. Ale uwaga - imputacji dokonuje się dopiero po podziale na zbiór treningowy i testowy! W przeciwnym wypadku wykorzystywalibyśmy dane ze zbioru testowego, co sztucznie zawyżyłoby wyniki. Jest to błąd metodologiczny - **wyciek danych (data leakage)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Podział na zbiór treningowy i testowy to pierwszy moment, kiedy niezbalansowanie danych nam przeszkadza. Jeżeli zrobimy to czysto losowo, to są spore szanse, że w zbiorze testowym będzie tylko klasa negatywna - w końcu jest jej aż >95%. Dlatego wykorzystuje się **próbkowanie ze stratyfikacją (stratified sampling)**, dzięki któremu proporcje klas w zbiorze przed podziałem oraz obu zbiorach po podziale są takie same.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zadanie 2 (0.75 punktu)**\n",

    "1. Usuń kolumnę `\"Attr37\"` ze zbioru danych.\n",
    "2. Dokonaj podziału zbioru na treningowy i testowy w proporcjach 80%-20%, z przemieszaniem (`shuffle`), ze stratyfikacją, wykorzystując funkcję `train_test_split` ze Scikit-learn'a.\n",
    "3. Uzupełnij wartości brakujące średnią wartością cechy z pomocą klasy `SimpleImputer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uwaga:**\n",
    "- pamiętaj o uwzględnieniu stałego `random_state=0`, aby wyniki były **reprodukowalne (reproducible)**\n",
    "- `stratify` oczekuje wektora klas\n",
    "- wartości do imputacji trzeba wyestymować na zbiorze treningowym (`.fit()`), a potem zastosować te nauczone wartości na obu podzbiorach (treningowym i testowym)"

    "Bardzo często wiele klasyfikatorów działających razem daje lepsze wyniki niż pojedynczy klasyfikator. Takie podejście nazywa się **uczeniem zespołowym (ensemble learning)**. Istnieje wiele różnych podejść do tworzenia takich klasyfikatorów złożonych (ensemble classifiers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Podstawową metodą jest **bagging**:\n",
    "1. Wylosuj N (np. 100, 500, ...) próbek boostrapowych (boostrap sample) ze zbioru treningowego. Próbka boostrapowa to po prostu losowanie ze zwracaniem, gdzie dla wejściowego zbioru z M wierszami losujemy M próbek. Będą tam powtórzenia, średnio nawet 1/3, ale się tym nie przejmujemy.\n",
    "2. Wytrenuj klasyfikator bazowy (base classifier) na każdej z próbek boostrapowych.\n",

    "\n",
    "Typowo klasyfikatory bazowe są bardzo proste, żeby można było szybko wytrenować ich dużą liczbę. Prawie zawsze używa się do tego drzew decyzyjnych. Dla klasyfikacji uśrednienie wyników polega na głosowaniu - dla nowej próbki każdy klasyfikator bazowy ją klasyfikuje, sumuje się głosy na każdą klasę i zwraca najbardziej popularną decyzję.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taki sposób ensemblingu zmniejsza wariancję klasyfikatora. Intuicyjnie, skoro coś uśredniamy, to siłą rzeczy będzie mniej rozrzucone, bo dużo ciężej będzie osiągnąć jakąś skrajność. Redukuje to też overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lasy losowe (Random Forests)** to ulepszenie baggingu. Zaobserwowano, że pomimo losowania próbek boostrapowych, w baggingu poszczególne drzewa są do siebie bardzo podobne (są skorelowane), używają podobnych cech ze zbioru. My natomiast chcemy zróżnicowania, żeby mieć niski bias - redukcją wariancji zajmuje się uśrednianie. Dlatego używa się metody losowej podprzestrzeni (random subspace method) - przy każdym podziale drzewa losuje się tylko pewien podzbiór cech, których możemy użyć do tego podziału. Typowo jest to pierwiastek kwadratowy z ogólnej liczby cech.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zarówno bagging, jak i lasy losowe mają dodatkowo bardzo przyjemną własność - są mało czułe na hiperparametry, szczególnie na liczbę drzew. W praktyce wystarczy ustawić 500 czy 1000 drzew i będzie dobrze działać. Dalsze dostrajanie hiperparametrów może jeszcze trochę poprawić wyniki, ale nie tak bardzo, jak przy innych klasyfikatorach. Jest to zatem doskonały wybór domyślny, kiedy nie wiemy, jakiego klasyfikatora użyć.\n",

    "Drugą bardzo ważną grupą algorytmów ensemblingu jest **boosting**, też oparty o drzewa decyzyjne. O ile Random Forest trenował wszystkie klasyfikatory bazowe równolegle i je uśredniał, o tyle boosting robi to sekwencyjnie. Drzewa te uczą się na całym zbiorze, nie na próbkach boostrapowych. Idea jest następująca: trenujemy drzewo decyzyjne, radzi sobie przeciętnie i popełnia błędy na częsci przykładów treningowych. Dokładamy kolejne, ale znające błędy swojego poprzednika, dzięki czemu może to uwzględnić i je poprawić. W związku z tym \"boostuje\" się dzięki wiedzy od poprzednika. Dokładamy kolejne drzewa zgodnie z tą samą zasadą.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jak uczyć się na błędach poprzednika? Jest to pewna **funkcja kosztu** (błędu), którą chcemy zminimalizować. Zakłada się jakąś jej konkretną postać, np. squared error dla regresji, albo logistic loss dla klasyfikacji. Później wykorzystuje się spadek wzdłuż gradientu (gradient descent), aby nauczyć się, w jakim kierunku powinny optymalizować kolejne drzewa, żeby zminimalizować błędy poprzednika. Jest to konkretnie **gradient boosting**, absolutnie najpopularniejsza forma boostingu, i jeden z najpopularniejszych i osiągających najlepsze wyniki algorytmów ML.\n",

    "Tyle co do intuicji. Ogólny algorytm gradient boostingu jest trochę bardziej skomplikowany. Bardzo dobrze i krok po kroku tłumaczy go [ta seria filmów na YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CC4N4z3GJc). Szczególnie ważne implementacje gradient boostingu to **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)** oraz **LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)**. XGBoost był prawdziwym przełomem w ML, uzyskując doskonałe wyniki i bardzo dobrze się skalując - był wykorzystany w CERNie do wykrywania cząstki Higgsa w zbiorze z pomiarów LHC mającym 10 milionów próbek. Jego implementacja jest dość złożona, ale dobrze tłumaczy ją [inna seria filmików na YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtD8wVaFm6E).\n",

    "W ostatnich latach zaczęto zwracać coraz większą uwagę na wpływ sztucznej inteligencji na społeczeństwo, a na niektórych czołowych konferencjach ML nawet obowiązkowa jest sekcja \"Social impact\" w artykułach naukowych. Typowo im lepszy model, tym bardziej złożony, a najpopularniejsze modele boostingu są z natury skomplikowane. Kiedy mają podejmować krytyczne decyzje, to musimy wiedzieć, czemu predykcja jest taka, a nie inna. Jest to poddziedzina uczenia maszynowego - **wyjaśnialna AI (explainable AI, XAI)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taka informacja jest cenna, bo dzięki temu lepiej wiemy, co robi model. Jest to ważne z kilku powodów:\n",
    "1. Wymogi prawne - wdrażanie algorytmów w ekonomii, prawie etc. ma coraz częściej konkretne wymagania prawne co do wyjaśnialności predykcji\n",
    "2. Dodatkowa wiedza dla użytkowników - często dodatkowe obserwacje co do próbek są ciekawe same w sobie i dają wiedzę użytkownikowi (często posiadającemu specjalistyczną wiedzę z dziedziny), czasem nawet bardziej niż sam model predykcyjny\n",
    "3. Analiza modelu - dodatkowa wiedza o wewnętrznym działaniu algorytmu pozwala go lepiej zrozumieć i ulepszyć wyniki, np. przez lepszy preprocessing danych\n",
    "\n",
    "W szczególności można ją podzielić na **globalną** oraz **lokalną interpretowalność (global / local interpretability)**. Ta pierwsza próbuje wyjaśnić, czemu ogólnie model działa tak, jak działa. Analizuje strukturę modelu oraz trendy w jego predykcjach, aby podsumować w prostszy sposób jego tok myślenia. Interpretowalność lokalna z kolei dotyczy predykcji dla konkretnych próbek - czemu dla danego przykładu model podejmuje dla niego taką, a nie inną decyzję o klasyfikacji.\n",
    "\n",
    "W szczególności podstawowym sposobem interpretowalności jest **ważność cech (feature importance)**. Wyznacza ona, jak ważne są poszczególne cechy:\n",
    "- w wariancie globalnym, jak mocno model opiera się na poszczególnych cechach\n",
    "- w wariancie lokalnym, jak mocno konkretne wartości cech wpłynęły na predykcję, i w jaki sposób\n",
    "\n",
    "Teraz będzie nas interesować globalna ważność cech. Dla modeli drzewiastych definiuje się ją bardzo prosto. Każdy podział w drzewie decyzyjnym wykorzystuje jakąś cechę, i redukuje z pomocą podziału funkcję kosztu (np. entropię) o określoną ilość. Dla drzewa decyzyjnego ważność to sumaryczna redukcja entropii, jaką udało się uzyskać za pomocą danej cechy. Dla lasów losowych i boostingu sumujemy te wartości dla wszystkich drzew. Alternatywnie można też użyć liczby splitów, w jakiej została użyta dana cecha, ale jest to mniej standardowe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warto zauważyć, że taka ważność cech jest **względna**:\n",
    "- nie mówimy, jak bardzo ogólnie ważna jest jakaś cecha, tylko jak bardzo przydatna była dla naszego modelu w celu jego wytrenowania\n",
    "- ważność cech można tylko porównywać ze sobą, np. jedna jest 2 razy ważniejsza od drugiej; nie ma ogólnych progów ważności\n",
    "\n",

    "Najpopularniejszym podejściem do interpretowalności lokalnych jest **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**, metoda oparta o kooperatywną teorię gier. Traktuje się cechy modelu jak zbiór graczy, podzielonych na dwie drużyny (koalicje): jedna chce zaklasyfikować próbkę jako negatywną, a druga jako pozytywną. O ostatecznej decyzji decyduje model, który wykorzystuje te wartości cech. Powstaje pytanie - w jakim stopniu wartości cech przyczyniły się do wyniku swojej drużyny? Można to obliczyć jako wartości Shapleya (Shapley values), które dla modeli ML oblicza algorytm SHAP. Ma on bardzo znaczące, udowodnione matematycznie zalety, a dodatkowo posiada wyjątkowo efektywną implementację dla modeli drzewiastych oraz dobre wizualizacje.\n",
